==========

When two or more galaxies are aligned perfectly down our line-of-sight, the background galaxy appears multiple times. This is called strong gravitational lensing, & **PyAutoLens** makes it simple to model strong gravitational lenses, like this one:

**PyAutoLens** is based on the following papers:

`Adaptive Semi-linear Inversion of Strong Gravitational Lens Imaging <https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7436>`_

`AutoLens: Automated Modeling of a Strong Lens's Light, Mass & Source <https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07377>`_
